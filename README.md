# Bookbot

## Description

This is a project created by following along on the [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/)
Bookbot project course.

I am working through boot.dev to learn python.

All this currently does is output a report on the number of words and number of
occurrences of each letter in the book "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Python 3

### Installing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ScottWiedemann/bookbot.git
```

- Create a `books` directory inside the cloned repo
- Download Frankenstein into the new `books` directories from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asweigart/codebreaker/master/frankenstein.txt)

### Executing program

- Change directories into the cloned repo and run the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```
